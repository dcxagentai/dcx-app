/**
 * CONTEXT:
 * Minimal hello-world surface for the DCX user app frontend.
 * This now proves the local React + TanStack + shadcn stack boots cleanly while consuming
 * the shared branding package for the common button primitive, shared backend welcome banner,
 * and logo asset.
 *
 * CONTRACT:
 * preconditions: The Vite React app has booted, is wrapped in a QueryClientProvider, and the local branding package dependency is installed.
 * postconditions: Renders a stable app hello-world screen with a shared branding logo, a shared branding button, a shared backend welcome banner, and one TanStack-backed status line.
 * side_effects: None.
 * idempotent: Yes.
 * retry_safe: Yes.
 * blocking_behavior: Non-blocking render after the in-memory query resolves and the shared banner performs its own backend fetch.
 *
 * NARRATIVE:
 * WHY this exists: To verify the MVP user app can consume shared branding assets and shared UI primitives while also connecting to the backend shell.
 * WHEN TO USE it: During initial setup and smoke testing of the app workspace.
 * WHEN NOT TO USE it: Once real user app flows replace the bootstrap screen.
 * WHAT CAN GO WRONG: Missing provider wiring, broken branding package dependency, broken asset import, or backend unavailability can stop parts of the screen from rendering correctly.
 * WHAT COMES NEXT: Replace this screen with the first real user-facing app routes and states while continuing to consume shared branding elements.
 *
 * TESTS:
 * - renders the DCX App heading
 * - renders the shared logo asset without import errors
 * - renders the shared branding button without import errors
 * - renders the shared backend welcome banner without import errors
 * - renders the TanStack query status as ready
 *
 * ERRORS:
 * - APP_HELLO_WORLD_PROVIDER_MISSING: TanStack hooks used outside the provider.
 *   suggested_action: Wrap the app tree in QueryClientProvider.
 *   common_causes: Provider removed from main.tsx.
 *   recovery_steps: Restore QueryClientProvider around <App />.
 *   retry_safe: Yes.
 * - APP_HELLO_WORLD_BRANDING_DEPENDENCY_MISSING: Shared branding imports cannot resolve.
 *   suggested_action: Reinstall dependencies and confirm @prompteoai/dcx-branding is present.
 *   common_causes: Local file dependency not installed or stale node_modules state.
 *   recovery_steps: Run npm install again in dcx_app after any branding package change.
 *   retry_safe: Yes.
